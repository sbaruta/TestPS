1) Assignment Requirement:

Please write a pet store application:
The pet store application is made up of 2 parts:

1) Pet Store Service component exposing Pet Store Operations as a rest API / jSON. The service has to be
implemented in java language using spring boot. The interface is specified in section 1. Interface. You can
choose the underlying data storage you want.

2) Pet Store Front End component consuming the rest API and enabling user interaction with the Pet Store. This
component has to be implemented in angularJS. You can show your creativity by designing an amazing UI.
We are looking for minimal proficiency in both stacks, we expect you to have both components implemented, and
you should shine in at least one of them.

Your solution needs to work correctly locally with a reasonable responsiveness. The application has to follow a
proper delivery cycle in an automated fashion: local build, local test, local deployment.

Nice to have’s:
A. Component deployed in bluemix public cloud (Paas)
B. Have authentication implemented
C. Have authorization implemented (user A can find/view only, user B can Add/find/view/delete)

2) Interface
You will find the description of the rest API to be implemented on http://petstore.swagger.io/.
You just need to implement the 3 following operations:
1) Add a new pet to the store
2) Deletes a pet
3) Find pet by ID

3) Assessment
Once you have completed your assignment, you should upload your assignment to Github or any equivalent
and send the link to your supplier or directly to ACEResourcing@rbc.com
Your assignment will then be reviewed by members of the team. Following a successful review, you will be
invited for a 1 hour in person interview

During the interview:
 Please bring your laptop to the interview
 You will be asked to perform a demonstration of your application for the 3 operations through the front-end and
through the rest of the API.
 You will be asked to do a code change of both components and re-run the full delivery cycle and to do the
demonstration again
